# Lung Endothelial Cell Atlas
Welcome to the github repo for lung endothelial cell atlas, where you can access the R codes for analysis in the manuscript by Schupp et al. (2020).

The Lung Endothelial Cell Atlas is a comprehensive and integrated analysis of several single-cell RNAseq datasets of human and mouse lungs that are readily available for public download [\[here\]](http://www.lungendothelialcellatlas.com/).
